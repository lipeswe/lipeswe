# 👋 Hi, I'm Fellipe Dutra.

I'm a third-year **Computer Engineering** student passionate about cybersecurity and cloud infrastructure.  
Currently completing the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate**, while exploring both **offensive and defensive security** through CTFs, write-ups, and hands-on labs.

I believe the best way to learn security is by building, breaking, and securing systems — responsibly.  
My current focus areas include:
- ☁️ Cloud Security 
- 🧩 Ethical Hacking & Penetration Testing 
- ⚙️ Automation
- 🔍 Threat Detection

💡 Always learning, experimenting, and sharing knowledge through projects and write-ups.
